## Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of several layers, including convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, dropout layers, and dense layers. The architecture is as follows:

1. Input Layer: Convolutional layer with 32 filters and a 3x3 kernel, using ReLU activation.
2. Max Pooling: Max pooling layer with a 2x2 pool size.
3. Dropout: Dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.2, applied after the first convolutional block.

This pattern is repeated for two more convolutional blocks, each followed by max pooling and dropout. The last convolutional block includes an additional convolutional layer.

4. **Flatten:** Flatten layer to convert the 2D output to a 1D feature vector.
5. **Dense Layers:** Two dense layers with ReLU activation and a final output layer with softmax activation for classification into seven emotion classes.

## Model Compilation

The model is compiled using the Adagrad optimizer with a learning rate of 0.1 and sparse categorical cross-entropy as the loss function.

## Training

The model is trained on preprocessed images normalized to values between 0 and 1. The training process involves 30 epochs with a batch size of 32.

## Model Saving

After training, the model is saved as 'emotion_detection_model.h5'.
